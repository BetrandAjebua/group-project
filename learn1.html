                <p>
                    Comprehensive diagnosis refers to a thorough and in-depth examination or assessment of a particular
                    subject or problem. It involves analyzing various aspects, gathering extensive information, and
                    considering multiple factors to arrive at a comprehensive understanding or evaluation.

                    Comprehensive diagnosis, in the context of a bot assistant, refers to the virtual or digital
                    evaluation of an individual's health condition and symptoms. It involves assessing the symptoms
                    experienced by the user, asking relevant questions to gather necessary information, and providing
                    suggestions or insights on potential causes or conditions associated with those symptoms. The bot
                    assistant aims to offer preliminary guidance and recommendations for further medical evaluation or
                    management based on the information provided.
