                <h4>Health Check</h4>
                <p>A health check, in the context of medication, refers to a comprehensive evaluation of an individual's
                    health status and medication regimen. It involves a thorough assessment of the person's medical
                    history, current symptoms, and physical examination, with a focus on reviewing the appropriateness,
                    effectiveness, and safety of their medications. The goal is to ensure that the medications being
                    taken are well-suited to the individual's needs and are producing the desired therapeutic outcomes.

                    Health check, in the context of a bot assistant, refers to the virtual or digital assessment of an
                    individual's overall health status. It involves reviewing the user's medical history, risk factors,
                    and relevant health information to evaluate their current health condition. The bot assistant may
                    provide reminders for regular health check-ups, screenings, or preventive measures based on age,
                    gender, and other pertinent factors. The goal is to promote proactive health management and
                    encourage individuals to prioritize their well-being.
